🚀 Built My Own AI Assistant Using Python & Tkinter! 🤖🎙️

I recently worked on an AI Assistant using Python and Tkinter for a simple but powerful desktop interface. It takes voice and text commands to perform various tasks like opening websites, checking the time, playing music, and even shutting down when told! 🖥️🎶⏰

🔧 Tech Stack & Features:
✅ Tkinter – GUI for an interactive chat interface
✅ Speech Recognition – Converts voice to text using speech_recognition
✅ Text-to-Speech – Uses pyttsx3 for voice responses
✅ Web & System Controls – Opens Google, YouTube, Notepad, CMD, Calculator
✅ Custom Commands – Responds to "Good Morning," "What’s the time?" and more!

🛠️ How It Works:
1️⃣ User speaks or types a command
2️⃣ The assistant processes the input using speech recognition
3️⃣ The command is analyzed in the Action function
4️⃣ The assistant responds via text & speech
5️⃣ If needed, it opens apps, searches Google, or plays music 🎵

📌 Key Code Files:
🔹 ai_assistant.py – The GUI interface (Tkinter)
🔹 speech_to_text.py – Converts voice to text
🔹 text_to_speech.py – Converts text to speech
🔹 action.py – Handles user commands
🔹 datetime.py – Fetches the current time

💡 Lessons Learned:
✔ How to integrate speech & text processing in Python
✔ Using Tkinter to build a functional GUI
✔ Automating everyday tasks with voice commands

🔥 This is just the beginning! Looking forward to adding AI enhancements like NLP & ChatGPT integration next!
